# SLAM Learning Repository

Welcome to the SLAM Learning Repository! This repository contains resources and materials for learning Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). It consists of two main modules:

## Octave Tutorials on SLAM

This submodule includes tutorials and examples written in Octave for understanding and implementing SLAM algorithms. I used the lectures of 
Cyrill Stachniss and these scripts to better understand SLAM.

## Calibration Results for OpenVINS Algorithm

The second submodule provides calibration results that can be used with the OpenVINS algorithm. These calibration results are essential for accurate sensor fusion and localization. I used ROS bags to callibrate, which I could not upload (too heavy).

## Still in progress

We are testing algorithms and learning about other algorithms! Soon I will upload more work.
